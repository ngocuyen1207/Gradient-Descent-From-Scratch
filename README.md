# Training Project

This project demonstrates how to train a model on GPU using cudf and cupy with a custom gradient descent implementation. The dataset used is for smoke detection in IoT applications.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Contains the Jupyter notebook for running experiments.
- **src/**: Source code for data loading, model definition, training, and visualization.
- **results/**: Stores logs and plots from training experiments.

## Instructions

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure you have a GPU-enabled environment with cudf and cupy installed.
   
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Navigate to `notebooks/` and open `smoke_detection_training.ipynb`.
   - Run the cells to execute data loading, training, and visualization.

3. **View Results**:
   - Check the `results/plots/` directory for the training loss plot.
